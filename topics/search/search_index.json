It\u2019s much worse today, for we are now in a post-modern post-truth generation that even Bloom might not have imagined. </p> <p>Robert Reilly  (provacatively) argued that there was a much more dramatic \u201cclosing of the mind\u201d that happened in the Muslim world 800 years ago that is at the heart of the modern conflict between Islam and the West. (The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamist Crisis). The gist of Reilly\u2019s argument is aptly summarized in the forward to the book by philosopher Roger Scruton: </p> <p>[Reilly\u2019s] purpose is to show that Islamic civilization, which led to the urbane princedoms of Andalusia in the West, and to the mystical laughter of the Sufis in the East, underwent a moral and intellectual crisis in the ninth to the eleventh century of our era, when it turned its back on philosophy and took refuge in dogma. Several factors are responsible for this ossification, but the principle one, in Reilly\u2019s view, was the rise of the Asharite sect in the tenth century and the defeat of the rival sect of the Mutazalites. The Asharites found a potent voice in the Imam al-Ghazali (d. 1111), a brilliant philosopher and theologian whose tormented spirit found refuge at the last in a mystical oneness with Allah. Human reason teaches us to question things, to discover things, and to make new laws for our better governance. Hence reason was\u2014for al-Ghazali\u2014the enemy of Islam, which requires absolute and unquestioning submission to the will of Allah. In his celebrated treatise The Incoherence of the Philosophers, al-Ghazali set out to show that reason, as enshrined in the writings of Plato, Aristotle, and their followers, leads to nothing save darkness and contradiction, and that the only light that shines in the mind of man is the light of revelation. Although al-Ghazali\u2019s arguments are soundly refuted by Averroes (Ibn Rushd) in his The Incoherence of the Incoherence, Islam rushed to embrace the Asharite doctrine, which made so much better sense of the ruling idea of submission. Averroes was sent from Andalusia into exile, and the voice of reason was no more heard in the courts of Sunni Muslim princes.</p> <p>Like all sweeping narratives of history, Reilly\u2019s Closing of the Muslim Mind no doubt omits certain important exceptions and qualifications. But if the general outline of Reilly\u2019s thesis is correct, it means that there is a lot of preparatory work to do before fruitful dialogue between Militant Islam and the West can take place. It also means that simplistic attempts to \u201cbring democracy\u201d to the Muslim world are ultimately doomed to failure, for that world has been separated from the intellectual culture in which democracy can take root and subsist.</p> <p>Rambam in the Moreh Nevuchim was highly critical of the Asharite sect (Kalam). Many of his criticisms apply to the modern intellectual enterprise which are the rotten fruits of the \u201cEnlightenment\u201d (more on this later).  </p>"},{"location":"intellect/commonsense-loss/#closing-of-the-western-mind","title":"Closing of the Western Mind","text":"<p>A question.

No reasonable person supports surgically sterilizing young children in the name of transgenderism. No reasonable person celebrates the atrocities of Hamas terrorists. Such policies spell disaster for any civilization.</p> <p>The American Medical Association advocates that birth certificates should not report the biological sex of a newborn because its \u201csex\u201d is uncertain as it might change in the future.  This is how leftism has corrupted medicine and science. Biologically, sex is binary, either male (sperm gametes) or female (ova gametes); there is no third type of gamete. </p> <p>At the confirmation hearing of the the Biden-Harris nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, for the Supreme Court, Sen. Marsha Blackburn asked the nominee: \u201cCan you provide a definition for the word \u2018woman\u2019?\u201d Jackson, appearing confused, responded, \u201cI\u2019m not a biologist.\u201d  Blackburn chided Jackson, claiming that \u201cthe fact that you can\u2019t give me a straight answer about something as fundamental as what a woman is underscores the dangers of the kind of progressive education that we are hearing about.\u201d Ketanji Brown was appointed for being the first black woman to the Supreme Court! How did we get to the point that scientists and medical men can say that \u201cmen can become pregnant\u201d? </p> <p>Why does the Smithsonian Museum have a display that states that reason and the \u201cwork ethic\u201d is white supremacy? Why is the Left waging a war on free-will (criminals are guiltless), on the sanctity of marriage (LGBTQ+), on the classical belief that there are objective moral values? Why the rush to slaughter the unborn (abortion) and the elderly (euthanasia) which is murder. </p> <p>Such absurdities can only happen in the woke dominated West. So how did all this come to be?</p> <p>In Stalin\u2019s Russia, in Mao\u2019s Marxist China and in Castro\u2019s Cuba, the Left used censorship, coercion, force and murder (at a cost of tens of millions of lives) in pursuit of its goal of disrupting civilization. </p> <p>The Left also came to understand that there is a more effective way: the indoctrination of the youth\u2014by stealth\u2014with the promise of a compassionate and just society (that is especially attractive to the Jewish soul). </p> <p>The modern university is the engine of leftism that began percolating throughout the modern university a generation ago. One can see this leftist trajectory of the academy in the career of Richard Rorty (1931\u20132007), an influential American philosopher educated at the University of Chicago and Yale University. Rorty\u2019s academic career included appointments at Princeton and Stanford University.</p> <p>Rorty: This is the concept \u2026 which was used by American school teachers who had read Dewey and were concerned to get students to think \u2018scientifically\u2019 and \u2018rationally\u2019 about such matters as the origin of the species and sexual behaviour (that is, to get them to read Darwin and Freud without disgust and incredulity). It is a concept which I, like most Americans who teach humanities or social science in colleges and universities, invoke when we try to arrange things so that students who enter as bigoted, homophobic, religious fundamentalists will leave college with views more like our own [i.e. like postmodern Marxists of the Left].</p> <p>The racist or fundamentalist parents of our students \u2026 will protest that these books are being jammed down their children\u2019s throats. I cannot see how to reply to this charge without saying something like \u201cThere are credentials for admission to our democratic society, credentials which we liberals have been making more stringent by doing our best to excommunicate racists, male chauvinists, homophobes, and the like. You have to be educated in order to be a citizen of our society, a participant in our conversation, someone with whom we can envisage merging our horizons. So we are going to go right on trying to discredit you in the eyes of your children, trying to strip your fundamentalist religious community of dignity, trying to make your views seem silly rather than discussable. We are not so inclusivist as to tolerate intolerance such as yours.\u201d [Rorty and His Critics, Blackwell, 2000, Universality and Truth, Pages 20\u20131]</p> <p>A defining feature of the Left is that the professoriate will not use reason to enter into a dialogue with students coming from religious homes. Rather, professors will demonize and make fun of the beliefs of these \u201cna\u00efve\u201d students under their care, so that their views will seem so silly as to not even be worthy of discussion.</p> <p>Saul Alinsky (1909-1972) was a \u201ccommunity organizer\u201d in Chicago and guru of the Sixties radicals. He proposed direct confrontation and ridicule as effective tactics to pursue power. In his widely cited Rules for Radicals (1971) he proposed confrontation in the struggle for \u201csocial justice\u201d (which is entirely at odds with justice without the \u201csocial\u201d adjective). Alinsky urged his followers to pursue power to radically change America. Here are some of Arlinsky\u2019s rules for radicals. </p> <p>Rule 5. Ridicule is man\u2019s most potent weapon. There is no defense. It\u2019s irrational. It\u2019s infuriating.</p> <p>Rule 13. Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions.</p> <p>Make it personal.

So they have no basis for assuming that we have reliable cognitive faculties and thus undercut their trust in science. If they cannot trust their cognitive faculties that would include Marxist style materialism itself.

Scientism is the view that science alone gives us knowledge of reality. Philosopher Alex Rosenberg characterizes scientism as follows:</p> <p>http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2011/11/reading-rosenberg-part-ii.html</p> <p>\u201cScientism\u201d\u2026 is the conviction that the methods of science are the only reliable ways to secure knowledge of anything; that science\u2019s description of the world is correct in its fundamentals; and that when \u201ccomplete,\u201d what science tells us will not be surprisingly different from what it tells us today. (The Atheist\u2019s Guide to Reality, 2011 pp. 6-7)</p> <p>If we\u2019re going to be scientistic, then we have to attain our view of reality from what physics tells us about it.  Actually, we\u2019ll have to do more than that: we\u2019ll have to embrace physics as the whole truth about reality. (p. 20)</p> <p>He does not deny that chemistry, biology, and neuroscience also give us knowledge.  But that is only because he thinks they are reducible to physics. But even if chemistry and biology are not reducible higher-level, as others argue, the features of material reality are no less real and part of atheistic scientism. </p> <p>The problem with the claim that science is the only reliable source of knowledge is that it is self-defeating because there is nothing in any of these sciences or the scientific method that has established that there no other sources of knowledge of reality. So that science itself is even a rational form of inquiry (let alone the only rational form of inquiry) is not something that can be established scientifically. In fact, science itself is based on metaphysical presuppositions, for example: </p> <ul> <li>that there is an objective world external to the minds of scientists; </li> <li>that this world is governed by regularities of cause and effects; </li> <li>that the human intellect can uncover and accurately describe these regularities. </li> </ul> <p>Since science presupposes these things, it cannot attempt to justify them without arguing in a circle. And if it cannot even establish that it is a reliable form of inquiry, it can hardly establish that it is the only reliable form. Both tasks would require \u201cgetting outside\u201d science altogether and discovering from that extra-scientific vantage point that science conveys an accurate picture of reality\u2014and in the case of scientism, that only science does so. </p> <p>That is why the investigation of the philosophical presuppositions of science has traditionally been regarded as the province of philosophy. What is it to be a \u201ccause\u201d? Is there only one kind? (Aristotle held that there are at least four.) What is the nature of the universals referred to in scientific laws\u2014concepts like quark, electron, atom, or what is the nature of a law of gravity for the concept of matter. Scientific findings can shed light on such metaphysical questions, but can never fully answer them. Yet if science must depend upon philosophy both to justify its presuppositions and to interpret its results, the falsity of scientism seems doubly assured. Perhaps philosophy, and not science, is a stronger candidate for rationality.</p>"},{"location":"intellect/scientism/#failed-arguments","title":"Failed arguments","text":"<p>Is there any evidence for scientism? had a really powerful argument in favour of scientism? Not really:</p> <p>The technological success of physics is by itself enough to convince anyone with anxiety about scientism that if physics isn\u2019t \u201cfinished,\u201d it certainly has the broad outlines of reality well understood. (p. 23)</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just the correctness of the predictions and the reliability of technology that requires us to place our confidence in physics\u2019 description of reality.  Because physics\u2019 predictions are so accurate, the methods that produced the description must be equally reliable.  Otherwise, our technological powers would be a miracle.  We have the best of reasons to believe that the methods of physics \u2013 combining controlled experiment and careful observation with mainly mathematical requirements on the shape theories can take \u2013 are the right ones for acquiring all knowledge.  Carving out some area of \u201cinquiry\u201d or \u201cbelief\u201d as exempt from exploration by the methods of physics is special pleading or self-deception.  (p. 24)</p> <p>The phenomenal accuracy of its prediction, the unimaginable power of its technological application, and the breathtaking extent and detail of its explanations are powerful reasons to believe that physics is the whole truth about reality. (p. 25)</p> <p>Rosenberg\u2019s argument, then, is essentially this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The predictive power and technological applications of physics are unparalleled by those of any other purported source of knowledge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Therefore what physics reveals to us is all that is real.</p> </li> </ol> <p>How bad is this argument?  About as bad as this one (Superstition):</p> <ol> <li> <p>Metal detectors have had far greater success in finding coins and other metallic objects in more places than any other method has.</p> </li> <li> <p>Therefore what metal detectors reveal to us (coins and other metallic objects) is all that is real.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Of course, the world is filled with non-metal objects such as earth, water, trees and animals. Metal detectors are keyed to those aspects of the natural world susceptible of detection via electromagnetic means (or whatever).  But however well they perform this task \u2013 indeed, even if they succeeded on every single occasion they were deployed \u2013 it simply wouldn\u2019t follow for a moment that there are no aspects of the natural world other than the ones they are sensitive to.  </p> <p>Similarly, what physics does \u2013 and there is no doubt that it does it well \u2013 is to capture those aspects of the natural world susceptible of the mathematical modelling that makes precise prediction and technological application possible.  But here too, it simply doesn\u2019t follow for a moment that there are no other aspects of the natural world. </p> <p>Those who reject scientism, then, are not guilty of \u201cspecial pleading or self-deception\u201d. Rather, they are simply capable of recognizing a non sequitur when they see it. Those beholden to scientism are bound to protest that the analogy is no good, on the grounds that metal detectors detect only part of reality while physics detects the whole of it.  But such a reply would simply beg the question once again, for whether physics really does describe the whole of reality is precisely what is at issue.</p> <p>Bertrand Russell was well aware that, far from giving us an exhaustive picture of reality, physics in fact gives us is very nearly the opposite, and is unintelligible unless there is more to reality than what it reveals to us:</p> <p>It is not always realised how exceedingly abstract is the information that theoretical physics has to give.  It lays down certain fundamental equations which enable it to deal with the logical structure of events, while leaving it completely unknown what is the intrinsic character of the events that have the structure.  We only know the intrinsic character of events when they happen to us.  Nothing whatever in theoretical physics enables us to say anything about the intrinsic character of events elsewhere.  They may be just like the events that happen to us, or they may be totally different in strictly unimaginable ways.  All that physics gives us is certain equations giving abstract properties of their changes.  But as to what it is that changes, and what it changes from and to\u2014as to this, physics is silent. (My Philosophical Development, p. 13)</p> <p>Among the features of the world physics deliberately ignores for its purposes are those that involve final causality.  As Rosenberg writes:</p> <p>Ever since physics hit its stride with Newton, it has excluded purposes, goals, ends, or designs in nature.  It firmly bans all explanations that are teleological\u2026 (p. 40)</p> <p>As the words \u201cexclusion\u201d and \u201cban\u201d indicate, though, this is, yet again, merely a methodological stipulation.
